Products in the Derivative Market
* **Forwards** : It is a contractual agreement between two parties to buy/sell an underlying asset at a certain future date for a particular price that is pre-decided on the date of contract. The terms and conditions of contracts are customised. These are Over-the-counter (OTC) contracts.
* **Futures** : A futures exchange traded contract is similar to a forward, except that the deal is made through an organised and regulated exchange rather than being negotiated directly between two parties.
* **Options** : An Option is a contract that gives the right, but not an obligation, to buy or sell the underlying on or before a stated date and at a stated price.While the buyer of an option pays the premium and buys the right, the writer/seller of an option receives the premium with the obligation to sell/ buy the underlying asset, if the buyer exercises his right.
* **Swaps** : A swap is an agreement made between two parties to exchange cash flows in the future according to a prearranged formula. Swaps are, broadly speaking, a series of forward contracts. Swaps help market participants manage risks associated with volatile interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices.

Market Participants
* Hedgers : They face risk associated with the prices of underlying assets and use derivatives to reduce their risk.
* Speculators/Traders : They try to predict the future movements in prices of underlying assets and based on the view, take positions in derivative contracts. Derivatives are preferred over underlying asset for trading purpose, as they offer leverage, are less expensive (cost of transaction is generally lower than that of the underlying) and are faster to execute in size (high volumes market).
* Arbitrageurs : Arbitrage originates when a trader purchases an asset cheaply in one location and simultaneously arranges to sell it at a higher price in another location.
