An option is a contract that gives the holder of the option the right, but not an obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset on or before a stated date/day, at a predetermined price.
The option buyer or holder has the right but no obligation with regards to buying or selling the underlying asset, while the option writer has the obligation in the contract.

Options may be categorised into two main types:
* Call Options - buyer/holder a right to buy the underlying asset
* Put Options - buyer/holder a right to sell the underlying asset

Opening a position - adds to or creates a new trading position, can be either a purchase or a sale
* Opening purchase (Long on option): A transaction in which the purchaser’s intention is to create or increase a long position in a given series of options.
* Opening sale (Short on option): A transaction in which the seller’s intention is to create or increase a short position in a given series of options

Closing a position - reduces or eliminates an existing position by an appropriate offsetting purchase or sale. This is also known as “squaring off”
* Closing purchase: A transaction in which the purchaser’s intention is to reduce or eliminate a short position in a given series of options. This transaction is frequently referred to as “covering” a short position.
* Closing sale: A transaction in which the seller’s intention is to reduce or eliminate a long position in a given series of options.

Moneyness of an option
* In-the-money (ITM) option: This option would give the option holder a positive cash flow, if it were exercised immediately. A call option is said to be ITM, when spot price is higher than strike price. A put option is said to be ITM when spot price is lower than strike price. In our examples, the put option is in-the-money.
* At-the-money (ATM) option: At-the-money option would lead to zero( or minimum ) cash flow if it were exercised immediately.
* Out-of-the-money (OTM) option: An out-of-the-money option is one with a strike price worse than the spot price for the holder of option. In other words, this option would give the holder a negative cash flow if it were exercised immediately.

Option premium, defined above, consists of two components - intrinsic value and time value.
* The intrinsic value of an option refers to the amount by which the option is in-the- money i.e., the amount an option buyer will realize, before adjusting for premium paid, if he exercises the option instantly. Therefore, only in-the-money options have intrinsic value whereas at-the-money and out-of-the-money options have zero intrinsic value. The intrinsic value of an option can never be negative because an option holder is not bound to exercise an option if such exercise will result in a loss to him.
* Time value: It is the difference between the premium and intrinsic value, if any, of an option. ATM and OTM options have only time value because the intrinsic value of such options is zero
