**Forward**
A forward contract is an agreement made directly between two parties to buy or sell an asset on a specific date in the future, at the terms decided today. Forwards are bilateral over-the-counter (OTC) transactions where the terms of the contract, such as price, quantity, quality, time and place are negotiated between two parties to the contract. Any alteration in the terms of the contract is possible if both parties agree to it.

Limitations of Forwards
* Liquidity Risk : The tailor-made contracts and their non-availability on exchanges creates illiquidity in the contracts.
* Counterparty risk : Counterparty risk is the risk of an economic loss from the failure of the counterparty to fulfil its contractual obligation. This risk is also called default risk or credit risk.

**Futures contracts**
A futures contract is an agreement made through an organized exchange to buy or sell a fixed amount of a commodity or a financial asset on a future date at an agreed price. 

Limitations of Futures
They too have certain limitations in the context of limited maturities, limited underlying set, lack of flexibility in contract design and increased administrative costs on account of MTM settlement, etc.



Future Pricing depends on
* Demand and supply of underlying
* Cash Flow pattern

**Pricing Models**
* Cost Of Carry model (no-arbitrage model) - This model assumes that in an efficient market, arbitrage opportunities cannot exist.
	* Cost of transaction : Cost components of futures transaction like margins, transaction costs (commissions), taxes etc. create distortions and move the markets away from equilibrium. In fact, these cost components create no-arbitrage bounds in the market i.e., if the futures price is within these bounds around the fair futures price, arbitrage will not take place. In other words, because of the frictions in the market, for arbitrage to get triggered, it is important for the futures price to fall outside the no-arbitrage bounds in either direction for the arbitragers to make profit from the arbitrage opportunities.
	* No-arbitrage bounds : Practically, every component of carrying cost contributes towards widening of these no- arbitrage bounds. Here, we should appreciate that wider the no-arbitrage bounds, farther the markets are from the equilibrium. In other words, for the markets to be efficient, different costs of operating in the markets should be as low as possible. Lower costs would narrow the no-arbitrage bounds, which in turn would ensure the efficient price alignment across the markets.
* Expectations model 
	* According to the expectations hypothesis, it is not the relationship between spot and futures prices, but that of expected spot and futures prices, which moves the market, especially in cases when the asset cannot be sold short or cannot be stored.
		* Futures can trade at a premium or discount to the spot price of underlying asset.
		* Futures price gives market participants an indication of the expected direction of movement of the spot price in the future.
