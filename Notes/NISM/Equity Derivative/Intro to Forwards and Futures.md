**Forward**
A forward contract is an agreement made directly between two parties to buy or sell an asset on a specific date in the future, at the terms decided today. Forwards are bilateral over-the-counter (OTC) transactions where the terms of the contract, such as price, quantity, quality, time and place are negotiated between two parties to the contract. Any alteration in the terms of the contract is possible if both parties agree to it.

Limitations of Forwards
* Liquidity Risk : The tailor-made contracts and their non-availability on exchanges creates illiquidity in the contracts.
* Counterparty risk : Counterparty risk is the risk of an economic loss from the failure of the counterparty to fulfil its contractual obligation. This risk is also called default risk or credit risk.

**Futures contracts**
A futures contract is an agreement made through an organized exchange to buy or sell a fixed amount of a commodity or a financial asset on a future date at an agreed price. 

Limitations of Futures
They too have certain limitations in the context of limited maturities, limited underlying set, lack of flexibility in contract design and increased administrative costs on account of MTM settlement, etc.
