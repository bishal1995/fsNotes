There is asymmetry between zero and inﬁnity. What does that mean? Most of us have very ﬁnite capital but inﬁnite opportunities because of thousands of stocks.

The basis of Technical Analysis
* Price discounts everything
	* Technical analysis is a trend following system. Most technicians acknowledge that hundreds of years of price charts have shown us one basic truth – prices move in trends. The market is driven by mass psychology and pulses with the ﬂow of human emotions.Emotions may respond rapidly to extreme events, but normally change gradually over time. Fundamental developments are followed by price movements. Even though the market is prone to sudden unexpected reactions, hints usually develop before signiﬁcant movements. You should refer to periods of accumulation as evidence of an impending advance and periods of distribution as evidence of an impending decline.
* Price movements are not totally random and moves in trends
	* A technical analyst knows the price of everything, but the value of nothing, Technical analysts are mainly concerned with two things. Technicians believe it is best to concentrate on what and never mind why. Why did the price go up? It is simple, more buyers (demand) than sellers
		* The current price
		* The history of the price movement
* What is more important than why


**Top-down Technical Analysis**
Technical analysis uses top-down approach for investing. For each stock, an investor would analyze long-term and short-term charts. First of all you will consider the overall market, most probably the index. If the broader market were considered to be in bullish mode, analysis would proceed to a selection of sector charts. Those sectors that show the most promise would be selected for individual stock analysis. Once the sector list is narrowed to 3-5 industry groups, individual stock selection can begin. With a selection of 10-20 stock charts from each industry, a selection of 3-5 most promising stocks in each group can be made. How many stocks or industry groups make the ﬁnal cut will depend on the strictness of the criteria set forth. Under this scenario, we would be left with 9-12 stocks from which to choose. These stocks could even be broken down further to ﬁnd 3-4 best amongst the rest in the lot.

Technical analysis works on Pareto principle. It considers the market to be 80% psychological and 20% logical. Fundamental analysts consider the market to be 20% psychological and 80% logical.
