	* Furthermore, close observations in high-frequency data are  
highly correlated (Campbell et al. 1992; Campbell et al. 2012), which violates the inde-  
pendence assumption of most machine-learning models. Hence, it is critical to prop-  
erly process the raw data and convert them into meaningful inputs for machine learning  
models. To address this issue, the common practice in the literature to process high-  
frequency raw data is to apply the event-based protocol (Ntakaris et al. 2018; Nousi  
et al. 2019) together with the sampling strategy, which randomly sub-samples raw data  
at fixed events. Both the event-based protocol and the sampling strategy are forms of  
data thinning. Such approaches substantially reduce the size of the dataset and weaken  
the correlation among observation
